# Bank-Management-System

The Bank Management System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate basic banking operations in a simple and efficient way. It allows users to create accounts, manage transactions, check balances, and delete accounts securely. The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and uses file handling to store account data persistently, making it a practical example of how real-world banking logic can be implemented in Java.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Java, OOP principles, and file handling techniques. It also serves as a foundation for more complex systems such as GUI-based banking apps or database-driven applications.
